QUICK GUIDE: WHICH MODE SHOULD I USE?
(ElmaxiShark Optimizer v1.5.0)

To avoid issues and get the best result, find your user profile and follow these recommendations:

================================
BEFORE STARTING (MANDATORY!)
================================

1.  Step 1: First Lifesaver (Registry Backup): Click the "Registry Backup" button.
    > ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a manual backup, and is the **last resort** before the Restore Point.
    If you need to use it, double-click the .reg files **in Windows Safe Mode** to ensure conflict-free reversal.
2.  Step 2: Second Lifesaver (Restore Point): Click the "Restore Point" button.
    > 👍 Recommendation: The Restore Point is the safest and easiest way to undo major changes.
3.  Step 3: After applying any mode, RESTART YOUR PC.
    The app will remind you, but it is essential that you do so for the changes to take effect.

===============================================
PROFILE 1: Beginner User / Work Laptop
===============================================

* Who are you?: You use your PC or laptop to browse, study, or play occasionally.
  You want it to go faster, but you CANNOT afford for anything to fail.
* Recommended Mode: Basic or Balanced.
    * Why: These modes clean the system, disable telemetry, and speed up daily tasks without touching anything that could break stability.
    * Useful Tools: "System Cleanup" and "Shell Tools" (for quick access shortcuts).

================================
PROFILE 2: Laptop Gamer
================================

* Who are you?: You play on a *gaming* laptop.
  Battery and temperatures matter to you, but so do FPS.
* Recommended Mode: Balanced, Extreme or Gamer Mode.
    * Why: "Balanced" gives you a great boost without risking anything.
      "Extreme" optimizes GPU and system without aggressive network changes.
      "Gamer Mode" is now 100% safe (it no longer breaks virtualization) and will give you the maximum possible performance.

===============================================
PROFILE 3: Desktop Gamer (Desktop PC)
===============================================

* Who are you?: You have a desktop PC for gaming.
  You want the maximum possible FPS.
* Recommended Mode: Gamer Mode.
    * Why: It's the ultimate mode.
      It applies all safe network (Nagle/QoS), GPU, system, and power optimizations.
    * Tools: "Advanced Network" and "Advanced Debloat" (to remove resource-hogging bloatware).

===============================================
PROFILE 4: Expert User / Tweak Enthusiast
===============================================

* Who are you?: You know what `bcdedit` is, understand the risks, and want total control.
* Recommended Mode: Custom Mode.
* Your route:
    1.  DO NOT apply any 1-click mode (or apply one as a base).
    2.  Go to the "Custom" menu.
    3.  "Custom" allows you to select *exactly* what you want, including tweaks we removed from normal modes for safety (like disabling Hyper-V, CPU mitigations, or uninstalling Store apps).
